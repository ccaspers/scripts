Bashscripts and Modifications
==============================================
This repository contains modifications I use across all
my Ubuntu-installations. Since I am hording ubuntu-vms
which are all tailored for different purposes, I figured
it would be useful to put my scripts into a VCS.     

The idea was probably inspired by this blogpost
http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/       

## Current modifications
- aliases for nano 
- aliases for git-commands
- simplified setup for my .gitconfig

## Usage
Open terminal, then clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ccaspers/scripts.git
```
open the repository's folder
```bash
cd scripts
```
run the installer
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
After that, follow the installer's instructions.
